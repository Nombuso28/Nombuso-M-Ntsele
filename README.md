# 👋🏽 Hi there, I'm Nombuso Ntsele!

A creative communicator turned emerging software engineer — currently mastering front-end development through a mix of curiosity, coffee, and lots of code.

With a solid background in digital content creation and customer support, I’ve written high-performing blogs for clients like **GlobalSA**, **SANBS**, and **NCTA** (my content ranked in the top 5 for engagement — no big deal 😄). Now, I blend storytelling and tech to build digital experiences that are both beautiful *and* useful.

## 🌟 Background Snapshot

Before tech, I built stories and solved real people’s problems. I’ve worked as:

- ✍🏽 **Freelance Content Specialist** — crafting content that ranks and resonates  
- 📞 **Customer Support Specialist** — solving problems and boosting customer satisfaction at Bolt  
- 📰 **Communications Intern** — creating clear and engaging public messaging

These roles taught me empathy, creativity, and how to deliver work that connects — skills I now bring to tech.
